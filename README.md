Hello! My Sinatra Project, of Skincare Reviews, as a user database with access to skincare product reviews, as well as writing skincare product reviews. The concepts covered are ActiveRecord/SQL (database), has_many and belongs_to relationship, some ruby objects, along with minimial use of html and css.
